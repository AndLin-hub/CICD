CI/CD is process which developers integrate automation in the process app development and deployment to reduce the amount of bugs and conflicts that may occur in a team environment which require a lot of developers making it impossible for each individual to keep track of other peoples' progress and conflicts.The CI stands for continuous integration which means that code is constantly being developed and merged into a shared repository. This is used to prevent the need for multiple branches which may cause differing paths and conflicting commits further along the path.

THe CD can stand for two things as it can stand for continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Although they may sound interchangeable they have two significant definitions.Continuous delivery mean that it is constantly being delivered to the repository while continuous deployment is the automation to production. Continuous delivery means that changes are frequently being uploaded to the repository with the help of automation for bug testing as well to make sure the production is not taken down and to make sure that an reliable live product can be pushed out at any moment. Continuous deployment is the automation of the process of pushing a tested product from the repository to the live environment with new functionality.

Tools that are used to help for continuous intergation and continuous delivery:
